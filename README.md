# ZombieMindBCI
ZombieMindBCI is a first-person zombie survival game that utilizes BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) technology to measure meditation levels and control the character's state in the game.

This project is being developed as part of the 2023-1 Media Project at Ajou University and serves as a prototype version of the game "Dead or Unwind".
